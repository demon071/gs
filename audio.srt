1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,119
it happened so fast

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,639
I got up and started screaming at her

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,639
calling her an idiot

4
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,559
but my parents asked me to take it easy

5
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,639
and she said it was a joke

6
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,820
and she didn't think I'd react so intensely

7
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,999
my aunt remained seated

8
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,559
and my cousin asked me to calm down

9
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,439
and drink some water

10
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,820
but I grabbed my stuff

11
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,999
and as I was getting ready

12
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,959
I told my sister

13
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,359
she was getting $0 for her dream wedding dress

14
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,319
then I walked out

15
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,239
I heard louder commotion as I walked in

16
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,119
my dad and cousin followed me outside

17
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,719
trying to talk

18
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,300
but I asked to be left alone

19
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,479
my and dad spoke to

20
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,679
saying I was too harsh on my sister over a joke

21
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,159
and said that I know this is how she is

22
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,639
with her dark sense of humour

23
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,799
they said she's been crying

24
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,799
after I decided to back out of helping her

25
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,279
and said this ruin her wedding

26
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,079
they want me to reconsider my decision

27
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,439
since it might damage my relationship with my sister

28
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,500
but I refused

29
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,199
did I overreact info

30
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,079
it's my aunt that would usually bring up what happened

31
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,999
from time to time

32
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,919
and say stuff like if what happened didn't happen

33
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,559
you would have had at least 2 kids now

34
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,900
or do you know what day it is

35
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,380
your wedding anniversary

36
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,839
it's harsh but she stopped doing it anymore

37
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,039
maybe my sister is being influenced by her

38
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,759
but still it hurt the same

39
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,740
and more coming from my own sister
